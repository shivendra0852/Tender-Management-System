A powerful and efficient solution to manage the tenders built using Core Java, DBMS, JDBC and MySQL. This individual project streamlines the tender process, by automating the entire lifecycle of tenders, right from the submission of the tender document to the final evaluation of the tenders. The system includes features such as document management, bid evaluation, and reporting. This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement complex systems using Java and database technologies.
